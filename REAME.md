Nice! Here's a clean and professional-looking `README.md` for your agent called **Rabbit**, which accesses the browser:

---

```markdown
# 🐇 Rabbit — Your Browser-Native Agent

Rabbit is an intelligent software agent that can access, control, and interact with your browser to perform automated tasks, retrieve information, and assist with productivity — all from a simple interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Browser integration for real-time web interaction  
- 🔍 Intelligent search and data extraction  
- 🧠 Supports automation of tasks (filling forms, scraping, navigating)  
- 🗣️ Natural language command support (optional)  
- 🔐 Secure sandboxed environment  

---

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wchisasa/rabbit.git
cd rabbit
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if Python-based
```

---

## 🛠 Usage

Run the agent:

```bash
npm start
# or
python rabbit.py
```

Give it a command like:

```
"Find me the top 5 tech news headlines today"
"Log into Twitter and post a tweet"
```

Rabbit will open your browser (or use a headless session), perform the task, and return results.

## 🧠 How It Works

Rabbit leverages browser automation tools like:

- [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) or [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) (JavaScript)
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) or [Pyppeteer](https://github.com/pyppeteer/pyppeteer) (Python)

And uses built-in logic or AI prompts to interpret user input and map it to web actions.
